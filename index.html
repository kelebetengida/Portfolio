            <h3> ABOUT ME</h3>
            <p>
                My name is Kelebet, and I am a Seattle-based photographer. I was born in Ethiopia and have grown up in the Pacific North West for the past 10 years. I am a current Oceanography and Public Health student at the University of Washington. While my career in Science is alive and well; for the past couple of years, I have been investing in my passion for beautiful aesthetics and found photography to be my cup of tea. So now I’m a freelance established lifestyle/ Environmental photographer. While photography in today’s world is picture-perfect when really the perfect photography captures the imperfect world. So this website was found upon the desire to capture fully authentic and candid moments during my photography sessions.
